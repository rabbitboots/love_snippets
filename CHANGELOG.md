# Changelog (love\_snippets)

## 1.0.5 -- 2022-07-04
* Added system cursor test.
* Deleted 'ticker_text', a WIP that I uploaded by mistake on the 29th. You can find it in [this commit](https://github.com/rabbitboots/love_snippets/commit/4dfa122da4a684a93b5853637e00e4c016d04a31), if you're curious, though it doesn't really do anything besides apply a sine function to some sample text.

* coloredtext\_to\_string:
  * Include the optional alpha channel when printing color tables.
  * Add conf.lua.

## 1.0.3 -- 2022-06-29
* Added some basic coloredtext-to-string functions.

## 1.0.2 -- 2022-06-15
* Added incremental text snippet.

## 1.0.1 -- 2022-05-16
